# Transactional-Server
Async Transactional Server With Replication
CMPT 431 - Assignment 3

If you're a student in the class, i strongly uggest not trying to copy it since i was the first and probably only to use boost.asio, I had to get CSIL to install the library and asked the prof for permission.

If you use the same thing, you'll definitely raise suspicion.

Read the readme for the project on how to compile and use it.
