# Transactional-Server
Async Transactional Server With Replication
CMPT 431 - Assignment 3

If you're a student in the class, i strongly suggest not trying to copy it since i was the first and probably only one to use boost.asio, I had to get CSIL to install the library and asked the prof for permission.

Read the readme for the project on how to compile and use it.
